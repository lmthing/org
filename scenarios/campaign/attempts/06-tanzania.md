# Attempt ledger — 06-tanzania

Cross-round memory for the judge. **Read this before attributing a failure**; **append one entry at
the end of every round.** One line per attempt. This is how a fresh-context round knows a rung is
already exhausted and it must CLIMB instead of re-trying the same rung.

Format per line:
`R<round> · step <N> · <L0|L1|L2|L3> · <file#symbol> · verify=<PASS|FAIL|INTERRUPTED> · <evidence>`

_(reset — no prior attempts; the campaign starts fresh at round 1.)_
