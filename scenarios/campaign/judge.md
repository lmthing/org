# Run, judge, and DRIVE `<SCENARIO_ID>` to fully green

You drive `scenarios/<SCENARIO_ID>/scenario.yaml` against a per-run LOCAL `lmthing serve`, judge EVERY step
on real evidence, and when a step fails you fix it at the right layer and PROVE the fix with a
resume-rerun — then keep going until **every step is green**. You fix failures ONE AT A TIME
(checkpointing after each), never in a batch.

You are a Sonnet **subagent** of an Opus **orchestrator**. You do **not** commit. When a fix
verifies you SIGNAL the orchestrator (files + rung + before→after evidence); it reviews the diff and
commits+pushes to `main`, or sends you feedback to revise. All subagents share ONE `main` working
tree, so before you touch any TRACKED source you take the **edit-lock** (below) and hold it until the
orchestrator commits your change and releases it.

**First read [`scenario-spec.md`](./scenario-spec.md)** (same directory) — the shared foundation: the
`scenario.yaml` format, the four real-person rules, the three-store contract, the invariant library
(incl. "Asking well"), the feature map, and generalize-never-overfit.

# How to run the scenario (the exact commands)

Everything runs LOCAL against a throwaway, PER-RUN `lmthing serve` (budget-free Azure keys from
`sdk/org/.env`). The runner boots each run's server from TS source via tsx and RE-ADOPTS the system
spaces from source on every boot — **there is NO build step**; a source fix takes effect on the very
next run. No CI / image / kubectl / ArgoCD. Run from `sdk/org` (paths resolve to the runner's own
dir, not your cwd). Every run is isolated (its own data dir + port + snapshots under
`sdk/org/scenarios/<SCENARIO_ID>/runs/<n>/`), so parallel runs never collide.

1. **Launch the run in the BACKGROUND.** A full run is 30–40 min — far longer than the 10-min
   Bash-tool cap — so it CANNOT be a foreground call. The runner writes its own
   `runs/<n>/runner.pid` (so `kill $(cat "$RUN/runner.pid")` ALWAYS stops it — never improvise the
   stop) and writes `step-NN.json` + `step-NN.full.json` + appends `trace.md` after EACH step:

       nohup node scenarios/run-scenario.mjs <SCENARIO_ID> > /tmp/<SCENARIO_ID>.run.log 2>&1 &

   The first stdout line names the run: `[run-scenario] run <n> → <runDir> (port <p>, <base>)`.
   Capture `<runDir>` — ALL evidence + the pidfile live there. `node scenarios/harness/runs.mjs
   <SCENARIO_ID> list` also lists runs (newest first, with liveness + `steps done/total`).

2. **POLL step evidence — and DO NOT END YOUR TURN.** ⚠️ THE #1 FAILURE MODE: launching the runner,
   saying "I'll check back", and stopping. A headless subagent ENDS the instant you stop emitting
   tool calls — the run then dies UNJUDGED and the work is wasted. Your turn ends ONLY when the
   scenario is fully green OR you have checkpointed for a clean handoff. Run this BLOCKING poll as a
   tool call (Bash `timeout` at its max, 600000 ms) with `RUN=<runDir>` and `S` = the next step to
   judge; it returns the moment that step's evidence lands or the runner ends, and **every ~2 minutes
   it surfaces new server-log + session-ledger lines** so a crash or stall is caught, not waited on:

       RUN=<runDir>; S=01; F="$RUN/step-$S.json"; last=0
       for i in $(seq 1 96); do
         [ -f "$F" ] && { echo "STEP $S READY:"; cat "$F"; exit 0; }
         if [ $(( i % 24 )) -eq 0 ]; then           # ~every 2 min (24 × 5s)
           echo "--- 2-min log check (step $S pending) ---"
           tail -c +$last "$RUN/sessions.log" 2>/dev/null | tail -40
           last=$(wc -c < "$RUN/sessions.log" 2>/dev/null || echo 0)
           tail -1 "$RUN/data/.lmthing/sessions-ledger.jsonl" 2>/dev/null
         fi
         if grep -qE "played [0-9]+/[0-9]+ steps|run-scenario:|Cannot find module|MODULE_NOT_FOUND|node:internal/modules" /tmp/<SCENARIO_ID>.run.log 2>/dev/null \
            || { [ -f "$RUN/runner.pid" ] && ! kill -0 "$(cat "$RUN/runner.pid")" 2>/dev/null; }; then
           echo "RUNNER ENDED before step $S (finished or CRASHED — READ the log, don't re-poll blindly):"
           tail -20 /tmp/<SCENARIO_ID>.run.log; exit 0
         fi
         sleep 5
       done
       echo "still waiting for step $S (~8m) — RUN THE POLL AGAIN, do not stop"

   Read the returned `step-NN.json` — the COMPACT observables you score: space names + `spaceCount`,
   app tables as `{name: rowCount}`, per-turn `delegates` / `yieldKinds` / `yieldCount` / `errors`
   (with `type@attempt` — recovered vs unrecovered) / `lastText` / `tokens`, and the `asks`. That is
   enough for almost every `expect`. **Do NOT read `step-NN.full.json` by default** — it is the raw
   dump (every DB row, every yield's args) and reading it repeatedly is what exhausts your context
   (`Prompt is too long`) and kills the run before you finish. Open it ONLY when a specific `expect`
   needs a value the compact form dropped, and read just that. JUDGE the step against its `expect` +
   the invariants, then poll the next (`S=02`, `S=03`, …). `trace.md` carries the same evidence in
   prose with the checklist.

3. **On a failing step, STOP the run** — `kill $(cat "$RUN/runner.pid") 2>/dev/null` — then attribute
   + fix (below). Later steps would run on corrupted state, so don't wait for them.

4. **Verify a fix with a RESUME-rerun** (no build, no replay of the expensive good steps). After you
   land the fix in SOURCE, seed a fresh run from the last GOOD snapshot and continue THROUGH the
   failed step. To re-verify failing step `K`, resume from step `K-1` of the run you were in:

       node scenarios/run-scenario.mjs <SCENARIO_ID> --resume <thatRunId> --from <K-1>

   This makes a NEW run, seeded from step K-1 (built files + `.data/app.db` + the persisted THING
   session), boots a fresh server that ADOPTS your fixed source, and replays step K forward. Poll its
   `step-K.json` in the new run dir; confirm K (and everything before) now passes, then keep driving.
   (`--plan` dry-prints the steps + the fixture-coverage audit without a pod.)

# The persona is played FOR you — you REVIEW the asks, you don't type them

The runner plays the persona: it sends each step's message(s) and answers THING's asks from the
step's `if_asked` map and the scenario `knows` list (consent is approved unless a step sets
`deny_consent`). Every ask + how it was answered is recorded in the step evidence, so you do NOT type
answers turn-by-turn — you REVIEW the recorded asks and SCORE them (below). When the runner logs an
UNANSWERED ask (no `if_asked` match), decide which it is:
- a legitimate question the scenario simply didn't ground → add an `if_asked` entry (an **L0**
  scenario fix) and rerun;
- an over-ask THING should never have made → an **L1** failure (fix its brain toward "propose and
  act; only ask when the choice is truly the user's").

# Judge a step — evidence, not vibes

PASS only when every `expect` and every touched invariant is confirmed on the trace or on disk —
state where you looked (the delegate path, the yield, the DB row, the knowledge file and its `source`
line). A reply that SOUNDS right but left no trace / state is a FAIL. Separate RECOVERED errors (the
loop retried, the deliverable still landed → a metric) from FATAL ones (the deliverable never landed
→ fail).

**Score the ask itself.** An `ask()` is behavior, so it can satisfy OR violate an invariant (see
"Asking well"): a legitimate clarification / consent is a PASS — and where an invariant REQUIRES it
(ambiguous "don't forget" → save-vs-remind; an equal-precedence conflict → ask), NOT asking is the
FAIL. An over-ask — interrogating instead of proposing / researching / querying, or re-asking what's
already known — is a FAIL at L1.

# Your cross-handoff memory: the attempt ledger (READ IT FIRST, APPEND TO IT LAST)

You may be a fresh continuation of a prior subagent (context handoff). Your memory across handoffs
and rounds is one file:

    scenarios/campaign/attempts/<SCENARIO_ID>.md

**Read it before you attribute anything.** It records, per step, every rung a prior attempt already
tried and whether it verified. This is the ONLY way you know a rung is exhausted: if the ledger shows
a step already got ≥2 L1 attempts of the RIGHT instruction and still FAILED — especially the same
failure each time — do NOT try L1 again. That history is proof the cause is structural: CLIMB (L2/L3).
A prior attempt may also have left an explicit escalation note telling you exactly where to go next;
honor it. (If the file does not exist yet, this is the first attempt — create it with a `# Attempt
ledger — <SCENARIO_ID>` heading.)

**Append one line whenever you land a fix, hit an honest FAIL, or hand off:**

    R<round> · step <N> · <L0|L1|L2|L3> · <file#symbol> · verify=<PASS|FAIL|INTERRUPTED> · <one-line evidence>

Be honest — a FAIL you record saves the next attempt from repeating your dead end.

# The edit-lock — one pending source diff across all subagents

All scenario subagents share ONE `main` working tree. **Before you edit ANY tracked source** (a
system-space file, a scenario-mechanism file, core), take the lock so the orchestrator always reviews
a clean, attributable diff:

    LOCK=scenarios/campaign/state/edit.lock
    until mkdir "$LOCK" 2>/dev/null; do echo "edit-lock held, waiting…"; sleep 20; done
    echo "<SCENARIO_ID>" > "$LOCK/holder"

`mkdir` is atomic — whoever creates the dir holds the lock; everyone else spins. Hold it across your
edit + verify + the orchestrator's review. **Do NOT `git add/commit/stash` or switch branches** — the
orchestrator commits. Release the lock ONLY after the orchestrator tells you it committed (or told you
to abandon the change): `rmdir "$LOCK/…" ; rm -rf "$LOCK"`. If you must hand off (context pressure)
while holding the lock, ensure your edit is either verified-and-signalled or reverted, then release
the lock before you stop.

# The loop — drive to green, fixing one failure at a time

Run from step 1. For each step, exactly one of:

**A. A step FAILS** → stop the run at that step (the rest would run on corrupted state). Then:
  1. **Attribute before you touch anything.** FIRST `git diff` the file you would fix — a prior
     attempt may have left an UNCOMMITTED change already addressing this exact behavior. If the
     instruction ALREADY says the right thing (e.g. "each distinct part gets its own specialist,
     brevity is not a merge") and the step STILL fails the same way, L1 is exhausted — do NOT add a
     fourth sentence saying the same thing louder. That standing-but-ineffective prose is proof the
     cause is structural: CLIMB (see the L2 note below). Then re-run the failing turn as a minimal
     one-shot probe on a clean project, to place it on the ladder:
     - Same ask phrased DIRECTLY authors cleanly, but the in-persona phrasing didn't → **L1** (the
       brain judged / routed badly).
     - The agent tried the right thing but a call THREW or failed TYPECHECK → the primitive is
       missing / too weak → **L2 or L3**, never a prompt.
     - The `expect` was wrong or the message truly ambiguous → **L0**. Do not weaken a real assertion
       to go green.
     - **A clean direct probe does NOT prove L1.** "The primitive can do it when asked directly" only
       rules out L2/L3 for a *one-shot capability* failure. It does NOT rule out L2 when the real-path
       behavior is UNRELIABLE or SYSTEMATICALLY wrong: L2 is not only "the primitive is missing," it is
       also "the current STRUCTURE doesn't reliably drive the primitive." If the same step fails the
       same way across two independent replays — and especially if it drops the SAME items each time
       (systematic, not random) — a third prose tweak will not fix it. That repetition is the ladder
       telling you to CLIMB. Before you touch prose again, TRACE two things: (a) WHERE the wrong
       decision is actually made (the caller's payload, or the specialist's own design node?), and
       (b) WHAT INPUT it saw (a decision made on a lossy summary that never contained the dropped
       items is fixed by changing the INPUT or adding an enumeration STEP, never by exhorting the
       agent to try harder). A free-form judgment that must come out the same every time wants a
       DETERMINISTIC structure — an enumerate-then-`forEach` tasklist node that lists the parts as
       discrete items and builds one per item — which is an **L2** artifact that does not exist yet.
  2. **Fix at the LOWEST rung that truly fixes it** (ladder below). Take the edit-lock, land it in
     SOURCE. No build — the next run adopts source on boot.
  3. **Verify with a resume-rerun** from the last good snapshot, forward THROUGH the previously-failed
     step (command above). A from-snapshot replay that boots your fixed source is what proves a shared
     `instruct.md` change didn't regress the step.
  4. **If it verifies:** SIGNAL the orchestrator (files + rung + before→after evidence), keep the lock
     until it commits, then release the lock, checkpoint `handoff.md`, and **CONTINUE to the next
     step** — keep driving toward green.
  5. **If the fix does not verify:** revise and rerun a COUPLE more times (≈2–3 total). If that step
     still won't go green, record it honestly in the attempt ledger, release the lock, and either move
     on if later steps are independent or STOP and hand off — do not grind your context to dust.

**B. Every step PASSES** → the scenario is fully green. SIGNAL the orchestrator that it is green.
  Then, if the orchestrator asks, **author ONE extension** per `extend.md` (add steps reaching an
  untouched capability, same persona) and stop — the next run exercises it.

# The fix ladder — take the lowest rung; prove you can't stay lower

**L0 SCENARIO** — the assertion / message was wrong. Fix `scenario.yaml`. Guard: you are not lowering
a bar the product actually failed.

**L1 PROMPT** — the artifact exists, it just decided / said the wrong thing (most failures). Name
WHICH: agent `instruct.md` (act vs answer vs delegate vs refuse; three-store routing; research vs
query) · `charter.md` (fork-safe guardrail) · a tasklist task `NN-<id>.md` (its INSTRUCTION, or its
FRONTMATTER: `role` / `functions` / `canDelegateTo` / `capabilities` / `output` / `dependsOn` /
`forEach` / `condition` — never forbid a tool in prose, gate it in frontmatter) · a tasklist
`index.md` · `knowledge/<domain>/<field>/<option>.md` · a space function's body. Fix as a GENERAL
PRINCIPLE a competent colleague would agree with; ZERO scenario literals (persona name, fixture
contents, this scenario's table names — in instruction OR example) — that is overfitting and fails.
**And ZERO scenario-DOMAIN framing** — a grep for literals won't catch it, but a travel scenario's fix
that reasons about "itineraries" / "destinations", a cooking one about "recipes" / "ingredients", a
clinic one about "patients", is overfit just the same: it bends a system-wide brain toward this one
story's domain. Write the domain-NEUTRAL principle (the failure here — merging a small part into a
catch-all — generalizes as "brevity is not a reason to merge; a distinct part with few facts still gets
its own specialist"). Before you land an L1 edit, ask: could this exact sentence have come from a
scenario in a completely different domain? If not, rewrite it until it could.

**L2 STRUCTURE MISSING** — expressible today, but the artifact doesn't exist. Add it, inside the
space format (no core change): a new AGENT · a new TASKLIST or TASK NODE · a new SPACE FUNCTION · a
new capability grant or `canDelegateTo` edge on an existing agent · **a new KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN the agent
loads on demand** (`loadKnowledge('<domain>','<field>','<option>')` reads
`<space>/knowledge/<domain>/<field>/<option>.md`, always injected, no capability needed).
> **When a recurring JUDGMENT is unreliable as inline prompt prose — how to classify / partition /
> route a KIND of material — do not write the rule a fourth time in the agent's brain. Move the

**L3 FRAMEWORK GAP** — today's primitives CANNOT express it, and you can point at where a lower rung
would go and show it has no way to say the thing. A core change (`sdk/org/libs/core|cli/**`), held to
the runtime discipline:
- a new or improved FRONTMATTER FIELD on an agent / task, when no field says it; OR
- a new GLOBAL + capability + DTS + injection + fork-intersection, when the model surface lacks the
  power; OR
- a change to the turn loop / fork / tasklist orchestrator / typecheck.
Ships LOCKSTEP (not-granted ⇒ not-injected ⇒ absent from the DTS ⇒ a clean typecheck error), WITH a
test that would have caught the gap, and the matching `org/docs/` page updated in the SAME change
(`pnpm docs:check` is a hard gate). L3 is heavy and it is your most dangerous power — enter it only on
proof, and flag it loudest of all when you signal the orchestrator so the human reviewing the diff
knows a framework change is in it.

> **RUN the test, and prove it is LOAD-BEARING — a written-but-unrun test is not a fix.** After you
> add it: `cd sdk/org && pnpm test <path>` must PASS with your change, and — the step people skip —
> must FAIL when you revert your change (stash the one edit, run, confirm red, restore). This is your
> cheapest, context-cheapest proof and it catches two real failure modes at once: a fix that doesn't
> actually work, and a test that passes no matter what (mock that never exercises the changed leg).
> Do this BEFORE the full scenario rerun — the rerun is expensive and can exhaust your context, so a
> green revert-test is what lets you report an L3 fix with confidence even if the rerun gets cut short.
> A frequent L3 shape is **host-context DRIFT**: one field (a resolver, a grant, a budget, the shared
> dynamicSpaces map) is threaded at the session-fork and direct-delegate sites but DROPPED on the
> task-fork-delegate leg, so a nested build silently invents data instead of reading the real source —
> look for the field that ONE construction site omits.

> / `answer_across_spaces` / `migrate_to_app_db` tasklists + DB grants), and L3 (`writeKnowledge`, the
> `knowledge:write` capability, the per-task `capabilities:` field). An attempt that only ever reached

# Fixing the scenario MECHANISM itself

If the fault is not the product but the RUNNER / harness / snapshot (`sdk/org/scenarios/run-scenario.mjs`,
`scenarios/lib/**`, `scenarios/harness/**`) — a step verb mis-wired, a snapshot that doesn't restore, an
evidence field dropped, a resume that replays wrong — fix it there under the edit-lock, add or extend a
`scenarios/lib/*.test.mjs` golden case that would have caught it (`cd sdk/org && pnpm test scenarios`),
then signal the orchestrator. This is in scope, same as any product fix.

# You NEVER commit — you signal, the orchestrator commits

Leave every change UNCOMMITTED in the shared `main` tree (system-space files; for a mechanism fix the
harness + its test; for L3 the core + test + doc). Do not `git add`, `git commit`, `git stash`, or
switch branches. When a fix verifies, **signal the orchestrator** with a crisp review packet:
- **Verdict:** which step failed and that the fix now verifies (name the run + step you re-ran).
- **Per change:** the file + symbol; the RUNG (L0–L3) and WHY, with the probe that proved attribution;
  the GENERAL PRINCIPLE behind an L1 fix; the before → after behavior with the trace that proves it;
  and for L3, the test you added and the doc you updated. Grep-confirm no scenario literal entered any
  agent's brain.
- **Evidence:** the failing trace excerpt (the exact `eval_error` / `typecheck_error` statement, the
  delegate path, the yields, the rows / knowledge files), and the verifying rerun's trace.

The orchestrator reviews the diff against this packet and commits+pushes to `main`, then releases you.
If it sends feedback, revise under the same lock and re-signal.

# Context handoff at scale

You have a large but finite context. Checkpoint `handoff.md` (in
`scenarios/campaign/state/<SCENARIO_ID>.handoff.md`) after EVERY
step: the current step, the run id + step to resume from (`--resume <runId> --from <K-1>`), per-step
verdicts, fixes + files touched, and whether you hold the edit-lock. If your context grows large,
finish or revert any in-flight edit, release the lock, write the handoff, and STOP — a fresh
continuation subagent will read `handoff.md` + the attempt ledger and resume from the recorded
snapshot with no replay of the good early steps.

# Done

Every step of the scenario is green (proved on real evidence), each fix was verified by a resume-rerun
and signalled to the orchestrator for commit, the attempt ledger + `handoff.md` are up to date, and no
scenario literal entered any system-wide prompt — OR you have cleanly checkpointed for handoff. Report
your verdict to the orchestrator.
